is there set free when the evaporatod vapour is condensed, is again in
part communicated to the sea by the winds, or, is one prefer to say so,
serves to reduce the loss of heat caused by evaporation, In conse-
quence of the rapid changes of the atmospheric strata over the ocean-
surface the quantity of warmth, thus afforded by the winde, ought not
to be destitute of effect. In other regions again the surface of the sea
may from an analogous cause suffer a loss of heat. Lasotly the conver-
sion of motion into 11881 1188 111 various ways an effect on the 888. The
streame, that circulate there, are continually resisted in their motion by
resistance of many kinds. Thus the whole of the very considerable
force, required to over-come this resistance, is converted into warmth,
as 8180 011 1118 011181 hand every raindrop, that falls upon the surface,
must there set free a certain amount of 11881, when its falling velocity
is stopped. The vis viva, which the winds contain, sets the ocean-into
811 undulatory motion and on their cessation there remains, as a conse-
quence of this motion, 8 88118111 amount of 11881, which the ocean has
acquired, unless it should merely have served to compensate the loss of
11881 through evaporation.

Again to determine the depression of level caused by evaporation,
two methods are available: either to endeavour to determine it by direct
observation, or to calculate it from meteoroloqieal observatiam>- of tlze locality,
having] first fully ascertained the law of evaporation. The first process 1188
been tried, but the observations are, it is known, 80 few and conducted
in such a manner, that the important question of evaporation from the
ocean's surface must 88 yet be considered as unanswered.

lee ehanye of level, resaltiny from rainfall‚ would 81 first sight
appear relatively easy t‘o be determined. But as in this case the water
received from rivers and from the melting' of ice, produced by the snow-
sall in the polar regions, must be taken into account, this question also
becomes difficult. We thus find, that no one of these three principal
questions can in the present state of science be answered, without leaving
a very large margin of uncertainty. An especial hindrance in this cas'e
is our want of accurate knowledge as to the amount of evaporation, a
quantity, which would be so necessary to know both for its own sake
and for the calculation of the warming and cooling' of the ocean sur-
face. We have accordingly no other alternative, than to attempt an
approximate estimation of the said quantities’ greatest or least value and
to see what conclusione may be drawn from them.
