1120 Streams produced from rainsall and other accensions
(ff fresh waler.

When rain-water is poured down u'pon a part of the surface of
the sea, the equilibrium between that part and the surrounding ocean is
in the first instant disturbed down to the bottom; thence a slow, general
motion of the sea-water takes place, whereby the level of the surroun-
ding water is slightly raised and that of the rainwater-stratum lowered.
But the sinking of the fresh water cannot however proceed farther, than
to about the point determined by the specific gravities of fresh and salt
water. Another motion is thereby caused namely a superficial current, flowing
out from the fresh water-stratum in consequence of the difference of
pressure in the superficial strata. Should the rain cease, results wifl
ensue precisely analogous to those, which take place between a warmer
superficial stratum and the surroundjng colder water. But should the
rain continue with unabated power, the stratum of fresh water must

continue to encrease in thickness, untill ,the consequent rise of level is ’

sufficient to make a surface-current, that carries off as, much water in a
unit of time as the rain yields, In this case it seems to be evident,
that, in regard only to the differences of pressure, but a, superficial
stream should be produced without any under-circulation.

The superficial currents, arising from meteorological wet, frequently
have a great velocity, since the sp. gravities of fresh 'water and sea
water are very different; at 15⁰ C. the relation is as 1:1.027, and at 0⁰ O.
as 1:1.02s3, if the sea-water contains 3¹l, p. c. salt, whereas the greatest
difference of sp. gr., that in the ocean can arise from differences of tempera-
ture, is about as 1:1.0043. On the other hand it is easily seen, that, if
warmth in the one case and ,rain in the other caused equal differences
of pressure at the heavier waters surface-stratum, the depth, at which
equilibrium prevails, must 'in general be greater in the former case than
in the latter; or, in other words, the superficial currents, caused by rain,
flow in a shallower bed than those caused by heat, provided the maximum
of difference of pressure is equal. But then the differences of pressure
are smaller at the subsurface-strata of the shallower stream, than at the
corresponding strata of the deeper‚ and the former ought thus to move
less rapidly than the latter. The intermixture of salt water from below
will of course influence the motion3 to that question Ι shall return farther on.

The rainfall at sea, is, as is known, very unequally distributed,
the greatest abundance falling to the lot of the higher latitudes, partly
