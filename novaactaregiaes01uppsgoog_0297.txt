present, as compared with ordinary river mouths, will then be the follo-
wing. The under-current, which enters an ordinary river-mouth, meets a
gradually diminishing depth3 that, which enters the mouth of a channel,
such as we are considering, soon arrives at a gradually increasing one.
The stream therefore sinks to the bottom of the basin, fills its hollows,
overflows its bars, whereby the water, that had previously lain at the
bottom, is raised nearer ‘to the surface. This water, thus raised to a
level of greater extent, which was previously covered with still lighter
water, diffuses itself there, and moreover is sucked to the borders and
innermost branches of ,the basin by the reaction-streams, which the rivers
produce at their embouchures. At these last spots the deep water rises
most rapidly towards the surface, . after having passed through many
degrees of dilutation, and returns, mixed with river-water, to the ocean.
The cause, which gives 'rise to all these motions is, in my opinion, to
be looked for in the vis viva to be found partly in the superficial stream
at the mouth of the basin, and partly in the much slower flow on the
large surface of the basin, and lastly in the more rapid upper-streams
in the vicinity of the river-mouths.

There is perhaps no branch of the ocean, where these streams
have been developed in so copious and various a manner, as in the sy·
stem of waters, that surrounds the coasts of Sweden. Ι proceed there-
fore, for the further illustration of the subiect, to communicate the prin-
cipal features of the water-circulation within that system, as far as it is,
chiefly through my own researches, known to me. This system is, as
is generally known, composed of a series of larger. and smaller ocean-
basins, separated from each other by promontories and island groups,
which penetrates into the land in many sinuosities from the southermost
point of Norway till Tomea, a distance in all of 1200 Engl. sear-miles.
These different basins, each of which'has its own hydrographical charac-
ter, are the Skaqeraclc and Katteyat, the mutual limit of which is the
Skaw point, the western branches of the Baltic between Bornholm, Rugen
and the Danish isles, the Baltic itself between Bornholm and the Aland
group of isles, the Botknz'an sea between the, Aland isles and the con·
traction of the gulf called Qvarken, and lastly the ,qulf of Botlmia, the
most northerly. The smallest channel of communication between these
is that, which unites the Kattegat and the western branches of the Bal-
tic. There, in the many straits between the Danish islands, the abun-
dance of river-water, which the three last divisions receive, as also the
under-current towards the Baltic must penetrate, and that under-current
