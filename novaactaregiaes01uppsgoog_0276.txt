The most immediate and essential consequence of such differences
of specific gravity between different parts ‘of the¹ ocean is then dzfferen-
ces os level, which differences however subsequently give rise to super-
ficial streams, whereby tlte liyhter reate»- displaces the beavier. By these
streame, in consequence of the smallness of their section, the disturbed
equilibrium 0311 only be restored slowly, and their continuance may the·
refore be considerable both as regards time and extent. If the causes,
which produce the change of specific gravit-y operate in a constant man-
ner, both the differences of level and the consequent streams will be
constant.

When the equilibrium of a mass of water is disturbed by causes,
which do not alter, or at least do not diminish the water's specific gra·
vity, the‘ disturbance must extend all the way to the bottom, and the
'differences of pressure at all depths beneath the lowest. level of the sur-
face will be equal. The equilibrium is then restored by a general mo-
vement of the whole mass, which will however be the less visible in
proportion as the mass of water set in motion is greater. We have
here an essential cause of the difference in the strength of the streame
observed in salt and fresh water. For of all the causes which 0311 pro-
duce streams in the latter, there is but one, which can sensibly affect
the water's specific weight, viz: variations of temperature. The sp. gra-
vity of sea-water on the contrary, besides being much more effected by
variations of temperature, is still further affected by the descent of fresh
water upon its surface. Even if the whole basin of the ocean were
filled with fresh water and that water exposed to the most extreme me-
teorological influences, which the different tracts of the earth present, thence
the superficial streams produced would not be nearly equal either in
power or extent to those we now observe in the water of the ocean ¹).

We proceed now to examine separately each of the 0311333, which
tend to produce change in the specific gravity of sea-water, with 3 view
to ascertaining their influence on the water’s motion, and for simplicity’s
sake we suppose only one of these causes to operate at a time. We have first:

¹) Although the importance of specific gravity‚ as affecting the streame in fresh
and salt water, has already been carefully point-ed out by Mamur, Ι have nevertheless
thought it best here to touch upon that subject, because it does not appear to me

that he has addueed the cause of the phoenomena in question, which I¹ look upon as
the chief.
