When occupied in examining -the wsaltness and the currents of the seas
round the coast of Scandinavia, Ι remarked certain circumstances, which
appeared to offer a new and clear explanation of the origin of some of
the ocean-currents, of which previous explanatione had been attempted,
grounded on assumed differences in the sea-water's specific gravity ¹).
This led me to a more extensive examination of the causes, which in
general give rise to streams in the sea, and Ι have published an essay
on the subject in the «Ofversigt af Svenska Vetenskaps-Akademiens For-
handlingar for Sept. 187 5» in connexion with a complete account of the

streams Ι had observed at the mouths· of the rivers, which fall into the
⁸ sea at Goteborg and Stockholm. My present object is to present the
results of that work in a more systematic form, and, at the same time,
to enter somewhat more fully into certain points, which in that work
have been only incidentally touched upon.

Even when we leave out of· consideration the possibility of oceanic
streams being produced by extratelluric attraction, there are, it is known,
many causes, which give rise to motion in the ocean’s water: gain or
loss of heat, rain, evaporation, freezing, variation of atmospheric pressure,
winds etc., are causes of this kind, all arising directly or indirectly from
unequal distribution of the solar heat. All the learned men, who have
made the problem of the origin of the oceanic currente a subject of
study, have paid more or less attention to all these causes, though often
in a one-sided manner, so that an almost exclusive importance has been
attributed sometimes to one and sometimes to another. Since however
the fact is, that almost every one of these causes has a somewhat im-
portant influence on the movement of the water in some special district
