in the form of rain and partly in that of melting ice, and another not
inconsiderable quantity falling* on a narrow belt in the vicinity of the
equator, the two intermediate zones, from near the equator to about·
40⁰ latitude, being comparatively but poorly supplied with rain. The ge·
neral result of rain at sea then, separately considered, ought to be four
surface·currents debouching upon the zones ill supplied with rain: two
greater, carrying cold and mixed sea-water from the poles to the tro·
pios, deviating towards the eastern, and two smaller, from the equator
to the tropics, deviating towards the western coasts.

An other and by no means inconsiderable amount of 'rainfall is
carried into the sea by the rivers, the mouths of which form the com-
mencements of currents, which however usually have only a local im·—
portance. In any places, e. g. in the Skagerack, where the collected
mass of several rivers falls in at one and the same creek, the quantity
of fresh water can nevertheless be sufficient to give rise to streams of
such strength and extent, that they must be attended to in navigation,
and even in the question of the general oceanic circulation the influence,
which the outpourings of the rivers may exert on the waters motion
must not be entirely left out of consideration.

ΙΠεο Streams caused by evaporatimae.

In fresh water evaporation causes a sinking of the surface and a
cooling of the external stratum. When sea-water evaporates, its saltness
is also enhanced and accordingly its specific weight increased from two
causes, producing, as MAURY has already shown, a vertical circulation
within the evaporating locality. This vertical circulation however soon
reaches a limit, beneath which it cannot easily extend. In those regions
of the ocean, where evaporation is greatest, the solar heat operates most
powerfully3 thus the increasing of the specific gravity is counteracted
by the heat, and, by other reasons, strata, that are heavy in conse-
quence of lower temperature, keep there constantly rising to the surface.
Again in localities, where the surface daily loses more heat than it re-
ceives, the ‚evaporation is little compared with the accensions of fresh
water, and the sinking surface-water therefore soon meets with strata
of sufficient saltness and weight to render the circulation difficult,

Of much greater importance in the oceanic circulation is the
change of level produced by evaporation3 for the increased hydrostatic
pressure, arising from the increased specific weight, is vanishingly small
