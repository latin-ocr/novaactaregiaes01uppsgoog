move fol-ward, and also other particles must flow to the place, whence
the stream set out; or in other words: the motion of the stream must be
propagated to other localities than that, where the forces, that originally
produced it, operate. But a stream may throughout its whole course by
mechanical action give rise to secondary motions in the surrounding
‘ water, and it is to streams of this kind that we shall now for a while
turn our attention.

Wherever a stream flows in contact with a quiet or more quiescent
mass of water, the molecules of the former will by friction communicate
a part of their motion to those of the latter. The quantity of the flowing
water is thus increased, while the velocity is diminished. Without at
first occupying ourselves with the question, in what relation the velocity
of the thus increasing stream stands to its mass, we may nevertheless
conclude, that a diminution of the mass in the surrounding water must take
place at every spot, where the stream communicates its motion to the
particles of that water, and carries them away in its own direction. This
diminution, like that caused by evaporation or by wind, must produce a
change of level, whereby the equilibrium is disturbed down to the bottom,
and this disturbance again must produce an afflux of water to the place
in question, whereby the water carried off is replaced. The said dimi-
nution cannot evidently be compensated by the original stream itself, for
this would require an increase of the streams velocity, in consequence
whereof the quantity of water-particles, carried of by the stream, would
even be increased; or in other words, the level would be continually
sinking in the part of the stream behind that, where the new molecules
are set in motion. To suppose again that the void can be filled up by
new molecules of the increased stream, would be evidently tantamount
to supposing that the motion, which had caused the void, had not taken
place. On the other hand an afflux‘ from the more quiescent water, out-
side the stream itself, both can and must take place, which motion will
be similar to that generally brought about by the disturbance to an un-
limited depth of hydrostatic equilibrium.

The velocity of the increased stream is another point of importance
for the question. If we designate with Wthe velocity and with m the mass
of water of the original stream, which passes by in a unit of time, and
with v and M velocity and mass of a following part, where it has taken
up into itself new molecules, supposing the velocity to decrease in the
