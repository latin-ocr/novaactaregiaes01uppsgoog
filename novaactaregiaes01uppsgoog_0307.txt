Gulf Stream, can therefore by no means have the same tendency to
diffuse itself which a fresh-water-stream from a river has. It can there-
fore long proceed in the form of a free-flowing ocean-current, and so
much the more as its tendency .to diffusion is counteracted by its vis
inertiae in the same proportion as its velocity is great. It must for this,
like fresh-water streame in a ·lake, produce reaction-streams on both
sides as well as beneath itself. Undoubtedly the Gulf-Stream thus

⁹ contribute greatly towards producing the circumstance, that the Polar-

water along the Eastern coast of America penetrates in the form of a
superficial current so far to the South, and also the under-current, which
proceeds towards the Gulf of MexicO, must in a great measure be pro-
duced by it.

Ο. THE vARIOUS CAUSES OF THE OOEAN-OURRENTs, WORKING
IN OOMBINATION WITH EAGHOTHER ΟΝ THE WATERS
OF THE FREE OGEAN.

I have in the preceeding pages endeavoured as far as possible to
illustrate separately each of the different causeS, which give rise to
ocean-currente, as well as the various kinds of streams thus originating.
But it is sels-evident, that the Ocean-currents, such as they in nature
present themselves, must, both as regards their force and their course, be
determined by many or all of these causes contemporaneously, and this
the more sc, the more extensive the currents are. The original prime-
movers, heat, evaporation, rainfall and wind, act in reality with very
different average force and in a very different manner in different parts
of the current's course, to say nothing of their variation with seasons of
the year etc., and of the irregularity of the winds and atmospheric pres-
sure3 this obtains especially as regards the oceanic surface-currentS, which
in their long course are exposed to all the vast differences of meteoro-
logical circumstances, which take place on the surface of the earth.
Every stream outside the region, in which its driving-force is especially
active, must associate itself with some other movement of the ocean,
and its course will therefore be materially influenced by the circumstan-
ces, which render such a combination with other streams possible. The
reaction-currents, which it causes, may again give rise to other similar
streams, and besides the reaction-streams can sometimes affect both the
form and direction of the original current, which is moreover so essen-
tially influenced by the contours of the bottom and the shores.
