that the salt under-current in the Baltic does not flow constantly but by
fits; also the proximity to the surface, which the ocean-water attains 10
1110 Skagerack, is different at different times. These disturbances are
assuredly not merely accidental, but also of a regular and periodic cha-
racter. They must 10 1110 first place be dependent on the different supply
of river-water in different seasons3 in proportion as the outflowing
river-water is more abundant, the under-current will be more power-
ful, and the changes of saltness at different depths more sudden. The
effect of the variation of the rivers on the waters level must however
in these great basins be slow and easily compensated by the more
rapid effects of the winds. In the summer-time westerly winds pre·
vail in the Skagerack, which in a certain degree dam up 1110 surface-
current between the Swedish and Norwegian coasts. But. if the water
is dammed up in the Skagerack, it must also rise in the Baltic, and
throughout the whole system of basius the thickness of the superficial
fresher stratum is then increased. The under-current 000 under these
circumstances be diminished, even though the supply of river-water be
increased, and by diffusion and other causes the different strata of water
will be more and more mixed. But in spring easterly winds are more
prevalent, whereby the passage of the surface-stream 0111,οΐ the Ska-
gerack is facilitated. By this the hydrostatic surplus-pressure of the
superficial stratum is raised throughout the whole system of basins; the
fresher water flows out more easily and the under-current accordingly
may assume a livelier motion. At this time of the year the surface both
in the Baltic and in the Kattegat is lowest, and the oceanic water 10
Skagerack is then found nearer the surface than at other times, a cir-
cumstance, which already in 1870 Ι explained as caused by the winds.

Furthermore the course of the streams at any time of the year,
may 110 modified by variation of atmospheric pressure and by storms.
Simply by variation of atmospheric pressure, which disturbs the order
of the hydrostatic pressures down to the bottom, the direction of the
streams may, without the cause being easily discovered, bereversed, and
the double streams exchanged for single. Suppose for instance that
over the whole of the Baltic the barometer sinks 30³⁸, this must have
the same, effect on the differences of pressure on the two sides of a ver-
tical 8001100 of the Sound, as if the water in the Kattegat had risen 4 cen·
timetreS. Streams would then under circumstances set in trough the Sound
both on the surface and at the bottom. Again, if we suppose the water-
strata to have assumed their normal position, so that differences of spe-
