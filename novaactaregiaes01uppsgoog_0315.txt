essential condition for the circulation, caused by the united effect of
evaporation and rainfall, taking the form here described, is the tempera-
ture of the water in the less evaporating region. Ι we supposed e. g.
that the warm surface-current preserved its once assumed temperature,
‘instead of cooling in the higher latitudeS, the whole mass of water must
ultimately be raised to a high temperature, in which case it seems pos-
sible that the molecules concentrated by evaporation might sink down,
so that the circulation went out from the most heated place into the
deep. The afflux would then take place from the surface, as is the case
in the Mediterranean, where the course of the stream is confined to
about the same latitudes, instead of crossing them as in the ocean. This
mode of ‘circulatim in the Mediterranean'is however also especially fa-
voured by the small dimensions of the opening for the admission of
the inflowing water relativ'ely to the surface exposed to evaporation.

I have endeavoured to shOW, that in the hotter part of the ocean
in consequence of evaporation, rainfall and heat, there ought to be for-
med a broad and deep hollow filled with warm and salter water; that
this hollow is continually filled up from below by two deep streams of
cold water, one from each pole; that the greatest part of the confluent
water evaporates between the tropics, but that another part, flows back
again over the edges of the hollow in the form of a shallow broad
stream of warm water, and that this warm current ought at a certain
latitude to be met by another superficial current of cold, but less salt
water, arising from the perturbation of the superficial stratas equilibrium,
which the rainfall in the high latitudes had left as one of its consequen-
ces. These results shOW, as regards the course of the surface-streams,
a by no means unimportant deviation from the phoenomena, which the
ocean actually presente. Let us therefore see, whether we have taken
account of all the most essential forces, the combination of which pro-
duces these currents.

By the rotation of the Earth the streams proceeding towards the
poles receive an impulse towards the East, those descending from the
poles an impulse towards the West, and even in this a reason is appa-
rent, why the ascending warm and descending cold streams should be
able to pass by each other, each on its own side of the channel, in-
stead of ' coming in collision3 but there remains an other and probably
still more active force to be taken into consideration. The broad belt
of warmed water between the tropics is attacked by the trade-winde in
two concurrent directione, viz: from N. E. and S. E. The water's ten*
