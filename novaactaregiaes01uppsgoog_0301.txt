drown up higher towards the surface3 nevertheless the saltness there is
very variable. Farther on in the Kattegat, as I have already mentioned,
the saltness rises to 2, and in the Skagerack to 25 ⁰s0 and in the Nor-
thern corners of the Skagerack sinks again to about 2 ⁰s0 in consequence
of the copious discharge from the Norwegian rivers.

If the level of the North-Sea was constant and the discharge from
the rivers continued unvariable, and there were no other disturbing cau-
seS, the water-strata throughout the whole system would arrange them-
self in an unchangeable manner, dependent on the areas of the sections
of the basins and the channels that‚connect them. The sp. gravity
of the flowing water-strata, would then not, in my opinion, be the dri-
ving force for the streams, but it would be the decisive cause of dif-
ferences of level, assumed by the surface-strata all the way from Lin-
desnaes to Tornea. These differences, causing the surface-stream, would
of course be greater between different basins os the system, than between
different points within the same basin. How great then is it possible ,
for these differences to be? Between the North-Sea and Bottenhaf
no level can be assumed at a greater depth than 23 metres, without its
being interrupted by land: hence the difference of level, due exclusively
to specific gravity, between the North-Sea and the N orthern extremity of
the Bothnian sea, cannot exceed 0546 metres, assuming the sp. gravities
of the waters to be respectively 1.0270 and 1.003; whence we obtain for
the whole distance an incline of only one in more than three millions ¹).

The course of the streams within the above described system
of waters is however disturbed by several causes, Ι have already shown,

¹) From the above mentioned part of the Bottenhaf, i. e. from Sundswall to
Levanger in Throndhjemsfjord‚ t-hc Swedish Geological Bureau, in 1869 and 1870,
caused a line to be levelled by Mr. A. ΒόΒΤΖΕιι, the Engineer‚ the details of which
measurements were published in the »Kungh Svenska Vetenskaps·Akademiens For-
handlingar» for 1871. On this occasion ἱ it was ‘endeavoured to carry the work to
such a point of accuracy, as to control tho statement concerning thc relative lovels
of the Atlantic and the Bottenhaf. The water-level in Throndhjemsfjord at the mean
between ebb and ssood was then found to be 0:725 met. lower than that of the Bot-
tenhaf at Sundswall. As however the two extremities of the line thus determined‚

- have not yet been directly compared with the mean state of the water in the. two

scas, a strict conclusion can not be drawn from this levelling relative to the quest-ion
here agitated. Nevertheless the result exhibite a remarkable agreement with that de·
duc-ed from the specific weight of t-he waters‚ an agreement, which deserves a some-
what greater consideration from the circumstance, that the extremities of the line le-
velled were determined at just the same season of the year.
