respect to the course of the ocean-currents, we should arrive, if we 611-
deavoured to form an idea of what motions those causes of currente,
which in the earlier part of this essay we have treated separately, would
produce in the free ocean. It here appeared, that only in the case, when
we take into account all the above named causes, these motions seemed to
correspond with those, presented by reality in a perfect segment of the
ocean, 6. g. the Atlantic between the equator and the North-pole. As
now these forces are evidently of such a nature, that in a complete segment
of the Ocean they must all come into operation, this circumstance appears
to me to be a proof os the correctness of the view taken. I have also
taken the opportunity to point out the need of thoroughly investigating
certain data, which have hitherto been much neglected, as being 116066-
sary for the quantitative determination of the causes of the streams,
which should be one of the principal problems of hydrography. I place
among these in the first place the amount of‘ evaporation and, wherever
it can be carried out, the determination of the mean water-level in diffe-
rent portions of the ocean.

If we take a general view of the effects, produced upon the ocean
by the different forces which originally set its water in motion, we find,
singularly enough, that each of these forces produces both of the kinds
of stream, of which I have been endeavouring to explain the essential
difference viz: a surface-stream, caused by a 1111111611, 61111 a deep-
stream by an unlimited disturbance of the equilibrium. Heat produces a
surface-stream by warming the water and a deep-stream by evapora-
ting it. Cold can produce an under-current by the contraction and still
more by the concentration of the water, but it then leaves at the sur-
1606 6 tendency to disturbance of equilibrium, which· shows itself in the
form of a surface-stream on the melting of the ice. Rainfall causes a
deep-stream as its immediate consequence and a surface-current of
lighter water as a secondary effect. Winds occasion directly surface-
currents, and deep-streams by changing the level. RiverS, and similar
constant out-pourings of lighter water, give immediately rise only to
surface-streams, but produce under-currente by mechanical reaction3
streams of this latter kind often accompany even the above mentioned.
The specific gravity of ,the water plays in all these cases a very varied,
but in some or other respect always important part. It usually deter-
mines the level of the water-strata, but not always. As to the origine
independent of the variations of specific weight are especially the
