ΟΝ Tm: GENERAL Causas or rm: OCEAN-CURRENTS. 21

When a river debouches into the sea, these phoenomena have an
entirely different character. By the river· water, cast upon the surface,
the equilibrium is disturbed only to a certain depth, that is, as soon as
the water· strata have arranged themselves as the supply of the river and
the dimensione of the creek require. The stream of river· -water flowing
o'ver the surface cannot maintain its original· direction. In consequence
of the higher level, which accords with its lighter weight, the river-
water must diffuse itself towards the sides, while flowing forward. The
river-water is thus diffused like a covering over the salt-water, dragging
with it everywhere molecules of sea-water, where the surfaces are in
contact. The result of the reaction will thus be almost exclusively an
under-current, commencing in the open sea and pursuing its way under
the broad Upper-current of fresher water to the mouth of the river ; if
the depth at the mouth is sufficient, the under-current will penetrate
into the river itself. At the mouths of the rivere, that fall out into
arms of the sea of considerable length and gradually narrowing, under-
currents of this kind will be most powerful.

The difference, that exists between the sea and lakes with
respect ‘to the streams caused by rivers, is sufficiently explained by
what has been said above. There is however one additional circum-
stance to be taken into consideration, namely the effect, that the ten·
dency to diffusion between fresh and salt water may produce. This
seams to be of a double character. In the first place it is clear, that at
the moment the streaming river-water diffuses itself in the salt-water, it
communicates to the latter its motion without suffering so great a loss
of vis yiva, as takes place, if the motion is caused exclusively by fric-
tion, as in a fresh-water lake. Secondly the diffusion causes a continual

, change in the hydrostatical equilibrium. If in fact we suppose a stratum

of fresh-water·to lie upon the sea-water, the level of which with respect
to the latter is determined by the specific weight of the water, the limit,
where equilibrium prevails, will by the diffusion be· brought lower, and
at the -same time the pressure in the immediately superjacent levels in-
creased. The final effect of this on the motion of the water-strata would,
I think, be to increase the power of the surface stream, and thus also
to strengthen the under-current.

For fuller illustration of the effect, that river-water has upon the
sea, I herewith communicate the principa] results of the experiments I
made on the 5³¹¹ Aug. last year at the mouth of the Geta-Eli* at Gote·
