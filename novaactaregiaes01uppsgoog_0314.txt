soon increase in proportion as the beginning evaporation causes a simi·
lar motion. The difference of level, which evaporation and subsequent
rainfall produces in a unit of time, will be after ‘a while, in consequence
of the increased temperature of the water, first equal to and then greater
than that arising from heat3 and it would seem as if the warm sur-face-
current ought in consequence to diminish and ultimately cease. Without
entering into the question, whether at any stage of the current’s deve-
lopement any such event take place, it is clear that when the tempera-
ture of the sea-water has reached the maximum, which is determined by
the limited accession of heat and the constantly increased loss of heat,
the evaporation and rainfall will generally spoken be constant, and thus
also the change of level, which they produce at a certain place in a
unit of time, will be a constant quantity. But in consequence of this,
the dzfference of level, caused by the above named chanqes of level, must
after a time obtain its maximum, on which the afflux to the evaporating
region must become constant. The sinking of the surface through eva-
-poration is then always compensated by afflux, and the level in the eva-
porating locality is thus maintained constant. If we now even suppose,
that the- surface had assumed a slightly hollowed form, the hollow
would soon be filled up by the effect of the heat. The arriving water
would remain there, its saltness and weight would be more and more
increased by evaporation, and soon a vertical circulation would arise3
this circulation would indeed be limited because of the greater density,
which the lower water-strata have from their low temperature, but that
limit would be continually lowered by the sinking molecules, which
would also carry with them into the deep the warmth they had acquired
at the surface. Thus the thickness of the warmed stratum must always
increase and consequently its level be raised, until it came to coincide
with that that of the surrounding water. The heated water would then
begin to flow out over this last, and the heat to produce its surface-
stream, just as if no hollow had been formed by evaporation.

We must not overlook the circumstance, that in this case the le-
vels of the water-strata have not been, according to the common rule,
determined by the proportion of their specific gravities. The warmer
water beneath the especially evaporating region assumes a much lower
level, than it according to its speciflc weight ought to occupy, and thus
exercise's a far less hydrostatic pressure than the surrounding colder
water. But just on this account this latter can flow in as if into a
hollow formed by evaporation, though no such hollow be there. An
