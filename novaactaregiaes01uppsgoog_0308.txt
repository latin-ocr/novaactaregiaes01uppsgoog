38 F. L. Erum,

Even if hydrodynamical science were sufficiently developed to
treat this complicated problem, it would in the outset be stopped by
want of a competent body of observatione. Although therefore-there is
but slender prospect of science beingsoon in a condition, fully to com-
prehend all the causes of the vast current-motione in the open ocean,
we may nevertheless seek to approximate to that interesting subject of
human research, in order if possible at least to discover, what circum-
stances must in the first place be investigated in order that the ques-
tion may receive its proper solution.

If we set out from the principle, that with exception of the
streame, caused by the winds or by other streams, the ocean-currente
are originally produced by differences of level, and if it be further ad-
mitted, that it is the unequal distribution of heat, evaporation and rain-
fall, which chiefly gives rise to these differenceS, it would seem desirable
in‘ the first place to inquire, how much the level of the sea in a certain
region may be altered in a unit of time by each of these 9911898, sup-
posing no motion for the moment to take place.

As regards the first, viz: the chansye-s of level caused by heat, there
is only one way of determining them, namely by calculating the abso-
lute quantity of heat, which the sea within a given region acquires or ι
19898 in a given time ; from the increase or decrease of warmth, thus
obtained as a result, the change of level must be deduced. As regards
the possibility of such a calculation, we may in the present state of
science assume, that no sensible amount of warmth can now be commu-
nica-ted to the ocean through the crust of the earth. But the amount of
heat, derived from the sun, is not only dependent on the sun's position
and the loss of heat, caused by the atmosphere’s·absorption and by the
reflection of the beat-rays from the surface of the sea, but also on the
more or less regular nature of these. If the surface is'smooth, the sun’s
hcat penetrates deeper; if agitated, a greater portion is retained in the
superficial stratum, and heat is more employed in forming vapour than
in the other case. The mean force of the wind has therefore here in-
fluence, so much the more, as it is also for other reasons favourable to
evaporation. The heat lost by evaporation and also by radiation, which
quantities are very considerable and the greater the warmer the water
previously was, must be deducted from the sunheat received. In such
a calculation it would be a mistake to neglect the atmospheric heat.
