under-current in the Atlantic, another though of subordinate importance
and more local operation, viz: the Gulf-stream’s mechanical reaction.
This combination of the streame with each other is facilitated by
a cause, which has been by some asserted to be the only cause of the
surface-stream's conversion into under-streams, viz: the relations of tem-
perature. The salter water of the Gulf-stream ought namely, after being
cooled in the higher latitudes, to sink down below the polar currents
fresher water, and this latter, as being colder, should sink below that of

’ the Gulf-stream in the places, where that stream retains a higher tem·

perature. If now the ascending warm stream attaches itself as a rection-
stream to the descending cold current, it ought somewhere or other in
the Polar regions to rise again to the surface, whereby it is chiefly di-
luted and cooled by the melting of ice. The in my opinion not impro-
bable theory of an open Polar sea has, as in known, been based upon
such a reappearance of the warm stream. With the great descending
under-current, caused by evaporation and rainfall, and to the formation
of which the trade-winds may also contribute, we need not suppose any
separate stream to unite itself, for it is dependent on a disturbed equi-
librium throughout the whole mass of the ocean. It seems however
probable that the cold descending surface-stream in a great measure
loses itself in it; if it should be connected with any vertical circulation
of great extent, taking place within the Polar tracts, we may find a cause
for this in the concentration of the water by the formation of ice at the
times and places, when and where that process takes place‘. But our
knowledge of the water’s motion in these regions is in fact to limited,
to warrant any general conclusions relative to its' causes.

The special object of this work has not been to explain certain
particular ocean-streamS, but rather to seek out the causes, in which
ocean-currente in general originate. But an important touchstone for
the correctness of a theory is the trial, whether the phoenomena, actually
presented by nature, can by it be explained in a clear and satisfactory
manner. It was therefore especially with respect to reaction-streams de·
sirable to endeavour to apply the theory to some particular case, where
the circumstances, which may give rise to such streams, seem to be pre·
sent in abundance. The explanation of the currents in the Scandinavian
waters and in the Strait of Gibraltar would thus be a secondary result
consequent to the proving of the theory’s applicability. For the same

reason it appeared to me desirable to inquire, at what conclusione, with
