If we for a moment suppose the water of the whole ocean of the
same temperature, but that an extensive portion of the surface has just.
been exposed to the influence of the solar heat, the water in that loca-
lity would expand and its level would be raised. The new level may
be supposed such as that required by the specific gravity of the warmed stra-
tum, without any lateral motion of the warmer water having been necessary.
But as the level was raised and the differences of pressure in the upper
strata increased, the warm water would presently begin to stream outwards.
Its level would thus again sink and the other â€˜water's rise, whereby the
equilibrium would be disturbed down to the bottom, and the consequence
would be, that the water from below would flow to the warmed place
till the equilibrium should be restored.

If the source of heat, that produced the change, ceased to act,
both the above described motionS, the surface stream and under-stream,
would continue, though with continually decreasing velocity on account
of the continually decreasing differences of pressure, untill all strata of
the same height attained the same temperature, and the surface accor-
dingly become everywhere normal. If on the other hand the source of
heat continued to operate with constant power, the water arriving from
below would in its turn be warmed and thus the motion be perpetuated.
In proportion as the warmed water receded from the warm locality in
the form of a superficial stream, it would part with its heat, and at last
such an equilibrium would be established between all the circumstances,
that caused the two streams, that the quantity of water, brought in a
unit'of time by the under-stream, would be equal to what was carried
off by the sursace-stream. What position would the warmer water take
with respect to the colder, when this state of things came to pass?

It is clear, that, if the two water-sarsaces are at the same level,
there can be no difference of pressure to set the sursace-stream in motion,
and again, if the warmer stratum assumed the position determined by
its specific gravity only, there would be no driving force to produce the
under-stream. The position of the warmer stratum must therefore lie between
these extremes: it must be such, that both strata are eut through by an
imaginary surface, above which the differences of pressure cause an out
ward-flowing stream of warm water and beneath it at under-stream of
cold. If the proportions were such, that the volumes of water, which
the two streams carried onward in the unit of time, had sections of equal
