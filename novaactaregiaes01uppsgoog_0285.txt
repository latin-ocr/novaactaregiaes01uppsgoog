other hand be room for two opposite streams as is' the case in the
Straits of Gibraltar. To the causeS, which give rise to that double stream,
I shall return farther on.

B. CAUSES, WHIGH IMMEDIATELY PRODUGE OCEAN-OURRENTS
· BY MEGHANIOAL ACTION OF A MEDIUM ALREADY IN MOTION.

Streams arising from these causes may be divided into two clas-
ses, first: “

IV:o Streams caused by the Winds.

Franklin endeavoured to account for the Gulf-stream as an effect
of the trade winde, and the winde were thought by Sir JOHN HERSCHEL
to be the principal causes of the ocean-currents. Though MAURY could
not deny that they have some influence, he neverthcless seems, in con-
sequence of his persuasion that differences of specific gravity were the
main-cause of the currents, to have considerably undervalued the effect of
winde. The importance of these has now of late been acknowledged
and maintained by M:r ORoLL. On this subject I will confine myself to
briefiy expressing my opinion, especially as the limites, which I have
bean able to find for the study of the ocean-currente, has not permitted
me for myself to examine M:r CROLL's workS, which will probably make
a more detailed explanation of this part of the question superfluous.

Every wind, that sweeps over a mass of water, produces, by the ,
friction of the air-particles against the water and their impact on the
waves, a superficial stream in the direction of the wind and consequently
an elevation of level towards the coast, as also a depression on the
opposite coast. By this the equilibrium of·the water is disturbed down
to the bottom and the water flows back from the elev-ated portion by the
ways, by which the reflux can most easily take place. Should the wind
operate uniformly over the whole surface of the water, the reflux can
only take place in the form of an under-current, the velocity of which
must depond of the depth of the water. Should it however operate only
on a part of the surface, suppose the left, the reflux will take place also
in the form of a surface-stream from the right side, whereby the level ·
there will be lowered, and so on; thus at length arise on the surface side-
streamS, which are supplied w‘rth water from the spots, where the level
has been raised, and which together with the original superficial stream
