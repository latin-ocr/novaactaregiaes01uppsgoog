the difference of pressure only extends to ‚a certain depth, than when it
extends to the bottom: and in general a greater time is required, when
the difference of pressure extends to a less depth, than when to a greater.

From these theorems, the truth of which I need not stop to de-
monstrate, I shall now endeavour to draw some general conclusione, re-
specting. the effect, which differences of specific gravity between the
waters in different parts of the ocean can have on the origin of oceanic
streame.

If we define the normal sea-level as that, which would result from
the force of gravity and the earths rotation with the mean barometric
pressure, certain deviatione from that level· must take place in conse-
quence of different specific gravity in different parts of the ocean, and
these deviatione ought to approximate t0, but not fully reach those,
which would be determined by the inverse ratio of the sp. gravities of
the water-strata ¹).

Let us first suppose the case of the water in a certain part of the
ocean being lighter than the rest down to a distance, n, below the sur-
face, but that the surface itself is everywhere normal. Two different
kinds of motion would immediately be produced. The lighter water
would be lifted by the surrouuding heavier, till the difference of pres-
sure at the new level of its lower side, η’, vanished, but, as its pressure
at all levels above η’ have now become greater than that of the heavier
water, it would instantly begin to displace and overflow the latter. This
movement of the lighter water would however require considerably more
time than the movement of the heavier water, whereby the lighter was
lifted and continues to be lifted, as its level sinks by lateral diffusion.
For the sum of the differences of pressure, which caused the elevation
of the lighter water, were in the first place greater, than the sum of the
differences, that caused its diffusion towards the sides. Secondly the
differences of pressure, which caused the first motion, must ,extend all
the way to the bottom, whereas those, which cause the latter, extend no
deeper than the lighter stratum itself, and even within the extent of
that have their chief effect confined to the superficial strata. With re-
gard to the velocity of these motions, that of the heavier water will be
relatively little sensible, because it takes place in a section of larger

area, but the motion of the lighter water will be seen to form a more
rapid and more clearly defined stream.

¹) Some important exceptione of this last statement will be hereafter noticcd.
