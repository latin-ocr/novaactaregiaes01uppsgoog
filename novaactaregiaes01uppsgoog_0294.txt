cold, whereas that of the superficial stream was very muddy, a further
proof that the under-current continually received fresh supplies from
the fjord.

The table also shows, that the saltness of the surface-stream
during the whole course gradually and continuously increases, and from
this we may infer, that the under-current does not suddenly invert its
direction at the place, where the reduced depth of the river renders its
further progress too difficult, but that it gradually during its whole course

. imparts portions of its mass to the upper-stream, as when from 3 mani-

fold bundle of eloth one rolls off one layer after another. The lowest
stratum, which has been least exposed to the influence of the upper-
current, arrives with almost undiminished saltness at the terminus of its
course. The upper-current’s reaction on the subjacent water must be
greatest, where its velocity is greatest, and accordingly we find, that the
greatest increase in the upper-current’s saltness during a certain distance
takes place between 7000 and 11000 f. from the mouth, just where the
bed of the river is narrowed from about 1300 to 650 f., but is widened
again afterwards. After passing the mouth the saltness of course in-
creases with greater rapidity, owing to the unrestrained afflux of sea-water.

The upper-current in its progress increases not only in saltness,
but in mass of water. The following calculation, based upon the amount
of chlorium contained in the waters, shows how much the samples taken
contained of such sea-water, as is met with 3000 feet above the mouth
of the river at the bottom. The table thus indicates the least possible
increase of volume, received by the superficial current by mixing with
the seawater, as also the dilation of the under-current:

We thus see that 100 volumes of river water, at a distance of
3000 f. from the mouth, have increased their volume to at least 135, as
the surface water carried with it 36.07 ⁰s0 of sea-water. In the fjord
