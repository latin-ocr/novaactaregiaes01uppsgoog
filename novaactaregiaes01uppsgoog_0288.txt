as on the other hand the streem's vis viva must be constant, if we
neglect the quantity thereof, that by friction is converted into heat, we
have also m . W²= M.v² or v = W.ll-;-{ which is greater than W. U,
whence we see that the velocity of the stream decreases more slowly than
its‘ mass increase& Hence the molecules in the following part of the
stream have a tendency to separate themselves from those in the pre-
ceeding, or in other words, the quantity of water at the locality we are
considering suffers a decrease. If the stream be a superficial one, the
level of the moving water should be thus lowered, and, if an under-
current, the level of the water above should also be lowered. The hy-
drostatic pressure of the moving water-strata is then reduced, and in
consequence thereof an afflux of water from the surrounding strata should
take place in direction to the former. The afflux of water, required for
the replacement of molecules carried of by the stream, is then helped by
the fact, that the velocity of the thus increased current does not de-
crease in the proportion of the increase of the mass,

In order in future to have a short name for the motions, which
a stream thus produces in the surrounding water, I have denominated
these motions reaction-streams, It is easily seen. that streams of this
kind, which in particular circumstances may be sharply defined and quite
powerful, must very frequently arise in the ocean. They must in the
first place accompany such streame, as originate in a disturbance of the
equilibrium, extending only to a certain depth, whether the disturbing
cause be heat or rain, or both united. But also the superficial streame,
caused by the wind, and the under-currentS, produced by the heavier
water's sinking and diffusing itself at the ocean's bottom, must give rise
to reaction-currentS. The velocity of these streams ought chiefly to depend
on that of the original current and the area of the section, in which the
stream, arising from reaction, has to move. That area is often very
great and the reaction-stream consequently scarcely sensible as a sepa-
rate stream. The streams caused by a disturbance of equilibrium, ex-
tending down to the bottom, ought to be the least calculated to give
rise to reaction-streams; in fact, in these cases, the original motion
itself takes place in all strata, though with different velocity at different
depths, and its velocity is moreover usually small.
