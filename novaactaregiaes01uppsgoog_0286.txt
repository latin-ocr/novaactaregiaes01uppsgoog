form a closed whirl-pool. Local circumstances must determine, wich of
these motions, the under-current or the lateral eddies, form the chief
channel, whereby the artificial water carried off by the wind finds its
way back.

In lakeS, where in consequence of their small extent the wind
covers almost the whole surface, the vertical circulation, which is so in-
dispensable a condition for the freshness of the water, is in a very
great measure maintained by the wind ¹). In the ocean on the contrary,
the surface of which can only be partially covered by any particular
wind, the superficial stream produced must also be accompanied by side-
eddies. The difference of level between two ‘opposite coasts, which a
'wind of great extent can there cause, may, in consequence of the great
length of the surface, on which the wind actS, be considerable, even
though the force of the wind be but moderate: how vast the differences
of level, which violent winds can produce, is sufficiently evidenced by
the so-called storm-floods. 'Phat the trade-winds, which collect the water
towards the equator from N. E. and S. E. and drive it towards the
east, are the cause of the so-called equatorial currente, is now perhaps
doubted by nobody. It seams also clear that an elevation 'of level,
caused by these winds on the eastern coasts of the continents, has a
material effect in the formation of the Gulf-stream, and that this in con—
junction with a corresponding sinking on the western coasts causes the
whirling motions with sargassos in their centre, which in the northern

. hemisphere iu consequence of the form of the continents are so clearly
developed.

vcs perhaps to be notieed. The lake has an arrow communication with the «Malva-en»,
the water of which contains a little salt. As long as Arst-aviken is fromn, the deeper
water also there is found to be slightly salter. e. g. 0.05 p. m. chlornatrium at the
surface‚ O.os at 3¹l2 fat-homs depth. But as soon as the ice is melted and the wind
ean freely operate on the surface‚ the saltness of all depths is uniform, and conti·
nuos so all the summer. The undulation in that little lake is of course very inconsi-
derable. so that no other cause can be assigned for the fact mentioned, then the ge-
