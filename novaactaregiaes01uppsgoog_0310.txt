40 F. L.. Erum,

According to Pouillet's researches on the amount of heat, radia-
ted from the sun ¹), compared with Meech’s work »On the relative inten-
sity of the heat and liqkt of the sun», there must daily fall throughout the
whole of the torrid zone on an average 75.3 ¹) kilo-units of heat on

‘ every square decimetre of surface. Let us ‚suppose that this quantity of

heat, deducting only one fourth for atmospheric absorption, i. e. 565 kilo-
units ,on the square decimetre, is taken up by the sea-water, and that
th'e quantity of heat contemporaneously communicated to the Arctic zone
is = 03 we have thus, with respect to the quantity of heat absorbed,
· placed the calculation in a footing far too favourable to the former re·
gion. The loss of heat through evaporation and radiation must be im-
mensely greater in the Torrid than in the Arctic zone. But let us sup-
pose them equal, or, in other words, take no account of these losses of
heat in calculating the difference of level between the two zones which
the phoenomena of heat would produce. W‘e may in this case be sure,
that we shall not find the difference of level, caused by heat, too little,
even though we should neglect the influence, which the atmosphere may
have on the sea’s temperatura, as also that arising from the conversion
of motion into heat3 as regards this latter we have moreover as yet no
reason to suppose, that any greater difference of temperature between
different regions of the ocean would be caused by it. The maximum
difference of level, which the effect of temperature could produce in a
day between the sea-surface in the Torrid and the Arctic zones, we
should therefore find by calculating the dilatation of the water, which an
accession of 56.5 kilo-units of heat on every square decimetre of the
surface would produce. If we for this purpose calculate the dilatation
of a column of water 56.4 decimetres high, when the temperatura is rai-
sed from 24⁰ Oentg. to 25⁰, we make the calculation in a manner too
favourable to the greatness of the dilatation. But the dilatationis ne-
vertheless only 17¹0 millimetres.

However imperfect the observatione of evaporation may be, we
may nevertheless with certainty assume, that the change of level, pro-
duced by it in a day within the Torrid zone, is considerably more than

¹) According to this determination every square centimetre of the earth’s sur-
face would receive 231000 gramme-unite of beat from the sun yearly, if there were
no beat-absorbing atmosphere and the heat, communicated to the earth, were uni-
formly distributcd on the surface.

goes up to 773.
