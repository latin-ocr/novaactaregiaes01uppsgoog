fed from the evaporating basin itself, thus discharging a quantity of
water corresponding to the surplus carried thither by the surface-stream.
This undercurrent penetrates trough the basins mouth into the ocean
and there sinks in consequence of its greater weight. Provided the di-
mensione of the mouth afford sufficient room for this double circulation,
the specific weight of the water in the basin can probably not attain
such an amount, that a real surplus of hydrostatic pressure should take
place from that side, were it not helped by the excess of water carried
thither by mechanical reaction.

This appears to me likely to be the true explanation of the
double stream in the strait of Gibraltar. The theory, which attempts to
account for the under-current exclusively by the greater specific gravity
of the Mediterranean's water, is besides destitute of the necessary foun-
dation, as long as we know nothing about the relative height of the
levels. The chief difference between the currents of Gibraltar and the
Sound appears to me to be, that in the first case the surface-cur‘rent
flows from a locality with constant level to one, where the level is al-
ways sinking, whereas in the second case it flows from a region, where
the level is always rising, to one, where it is constant.

In further confirmation of this view Ι may be allowed to adduce
an experiment, which Ι made to convince myself, that a double stream
of this kind may be produced independently of the specific weight of the
water-strata. In a box of 12 decimetres length and 1¹5¹, decimctres broad
and deep I set up for the purpose a vertical partition in the middle,

in the upper part of which was an opening, about ιβ, decimetre broad
and 1 dec. deep. The box was filled with fresh water and a stream,
yielding only about 100 cub.cent. per minute, was conducted to one end
of the box behind a pack of hards there put in, which caused the stream
to be uniformly distributed3 at the other end of the box the water esca-
ped through a hole at the sursace. Then on immersing a glass rod,
wetted with a solution of aniline‚ perpendicular to the bot-tom of the
box, I could by the diffusion of the colour observe the slight motion of
the water at any depth. When the rod was placed at the opening in
the partition, a constant under-stream was observed to flow from the di-
vision of the box, from which the water escaped, to that, into which it
was admitted. This stream was then analogous to that, which existe
between the Mediterranean and the ocean, with merely the difference,
that in this case the water flowed instead of evaporating from the sur·
face, and that no salt was present.
