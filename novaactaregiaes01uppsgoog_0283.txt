in comparison with the decrease, produced by the diminution of the
waterpillar’s height. Now as evaporation takes place with very different
rapidity in different localities and attains its maximum in the regions,
where the rainfall is least, viz: the region of the trade-winde, this cir-
cumstance must necessarily have a considerable influence on the oceanic
circulation.

By evaporation the equilibrium of the water-particles is disturbed
down to the bottom, and accordingly the motion, which takes place in
order to fill up the vacuum, may extend to the whole mass, although
the velocity will be different at different depths. If we suppose a cup-

shaped·hollow to be formed by evaporation in the surface of a mass of ·

water, the difference of pressure in the level, that pasees through the
centre of the hollow, will be greater than in any level above it, and the
motion of the water-particles in that plane will therefore be more rapid
than in any plane above it. But in all lower levels the difference of
pressure is the same as in that level, and it would consequently be un·
reasonable to suppose that the hollow would be filled only by superficial
streame of its own depth. Motion must also arise in the lower strata,
and this motion under the centre of the hollow must be vert-ically upward.
It will accordingly depend upon the relative dimensione of the water-
mass and the hollow, and on the inclinatione of the latter’s surface,
whether the filling of the hollow be owing more ιο the afflux of the
water from the sides or the rise of that beneath.

The depression of the ocean’s surface through evaporation is ex-
tremely small in comparison to the extent of the sunken surface, and
the volume of the hollow is extremely small in comparison with that of
the ocean. The motion therefore of the approaching particles under the
surface of the hollow will be chiefly upward, but will gradually approach
ιο, horizontal, as the distance from the locality of the hollow increases.
Thus the great evaporation within the torrid zone ought to produce two
sIOW, deep motions in the sea, one in each hemisphere, which, origina-
ting in the higher latitudes, meet in the neighbourhood of the equator.
As evaporation is greater in the regions near the equator than in those
more distant — if we except the narrow equatorial belt that includes
the region of the calms and rain — the quantity of water, which in a
unit of time must flow to the former region, will be relatively greater than
that, which moves towards the latter,· but the former must pass through
a greater distance reckoned from the origin of the stream. In conse-
quence of these causes the under-streame, caused by evaporation, ought to
