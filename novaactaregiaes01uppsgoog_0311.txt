l.6¹¹¹¹¹²· According to observatione, which I have lately caused to be made
on a little island in the Skagerack‚ in which the evaporation is measu-
red in evaporimeters of portland-cement with sur-faces of between 4 and
5 square metres, it amounts there (in 60⁰ N. Lat.) on an average to
5¹³⁸·- a day during July and August. ¹). Hence, even if we do not lay
- to much weight upon the statements of daily evaporation of 13⁰³* within
the tropice, we may nevertheless rest assured, that the evaporation in
that extensive and with rain ill supplied region of the ocean, which is
swept over by the trade-winds, must produce a sar deeper hollow, than
can bc filled up by the dilatation os tlte water there occasioned dur-inq the
sanae time by the colar heat.

While the amount of evaporation decreases in higher latitudes,
that of rainfall increases. Within the icc-covered regions of the Arctic
zone the evaporation is very nearly = Ο. The precipitation of atmos-
pherical moisture however continues to display its activity by depressing
the masses of ice beneath the weight of new layers formed upon them,
and by the ice-blocks detached from the glaciers. But of the two kinds
of motion, which, as Ι have shown above, rainfall occasions in the ocean,
the one is exactly similar to that produced by evaporation, so that rain-
fall in kiqher latitudes has just the same effect on the ocean's movement as
evaporation in lower. Evaporation in fact disturbs the equilibrium down
to the bottom, and thus causes throughout the whole area of the section
an affiux to the evaporating region. Rainfall, as long as the fall conti-
nues, also disturbs the equilibrium all the way down to the bottom, and
causes an efflux from the region, where it falls. The other effect, pro-
duced by ‘rainfall, consists in a perturbation of the equilibrium of the
superficial strata, which continues long after the rain has ceased to fall,
whereby, unless the motion be prevented by other causes, a surface-
stream of more durable character must be produced, followed by an in-
ward flowing current beneath it.

Already the difference of level between the equatorial and polar
tracts of the ocean, which was caused by evaporation, was much greater
than the opposite difference caused by heat. By the effect of rainfall,
which may be considered as a complement to evaporation, this level-

‘¹) Of these observatione, which have originated in the interest taken in the
question by the Goteborgs Hushallnings Society and the Lord-Lieutenant of the di-
strict, Count Ennnnstnm Ι hope het-caster, when they have been continued some
time longer, to give a fuller account.
