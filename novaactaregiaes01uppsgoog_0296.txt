highest point should be 6⁶¹⁰· above that at the mouth, it only requires an
incline of l,in 90000. Now, according to the measurements of the to-
pographical corpe, the difference between the rivers level at 14900 me·
tres from the mouth and the mean height of the water in the fjord
amounts to 27.6⁰‚¹¹¹·, which indicates an incline of 1 in 540003 throughout
this distance the stream'flows very uniform. If we further recollect that
a great part of the preponderant pressure at the mouth would be employed
in overcoming the friction of the outflowing fresh water-stream, so that not
even the whole of the above mentioned 6⁰³²· water-pressure should be availa-
ble actually to drive the under-current forward, one cannot but conclude,
that the supposition‚ that the under-current described is urged forward
only by the difference of specific gravity, is in highest degree impro-
bable, whereas the vis viva of the surface-current is evidently a power
of sufficient energy to be capable of the effect here to be accounted for.

A river may therefore, as regards its effect upon the sea-water at
its embouchure, be compared to a pump, the piston of which throws out
as much’ water as it sucks up from behind3 the force, that sets the
pump-piston in motion, here corresponds to the river-waters vis viva.
This relation ought to be of practical importance to many maritime
towns, situated somewhat above the mouths of rivers. The sea-water,
which for many purposes it is important to obtain, has to be brought
from a distance of some miles to such towns, if it is to be taken from
the surface.⁴ But by the force, we have here described, it is actually
brought fresh and clear and almost undiluted right into the towns, where
it is wanted. ⁷

With respect to' the reaction-streams of rivers, lastly it deserves
to be noticed, that they must play an important part in the case of se-
dimental depositions and delta-formations at the mouths of rivers. But
as this question is foreign to the object of this essay, I shall not dwell
upon it.

Inclosed ocean-basins, in which the rainfall exceeds the evapora-
tion, are in fact nothing more than river-mouths of unusually large di-
mensions and we may therefore v‘ery reasonably expect to find again
there the same phoenomena, that Ι have described as taking place at the
mouth of Gota-eIf, though on a different scale. If such a basin commu-
nicates with the ocean only by a narrow and relatively shallow channel,
we may als0, if we like, consider the surface-current in that channel as a
new river, and the basin above it as a dilatation of the river. The
chief difference, which the phoenomena of the streams.in such a locality
