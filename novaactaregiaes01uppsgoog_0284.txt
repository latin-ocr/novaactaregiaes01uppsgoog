the parts of the evaporating region more distant from the equator.

Ι (10 1101 know that attention 1138 118811 paid 10 1118 importance of
evaporation for the formation of the cold under-current in the ocean ¹),
whereas evaporation has long been recognized as the cause of the cur-
rents, that exist between the ocean and separate basius such as the Me-
diterranean, in which the annual evaporation exceeds the rainfall. Even
if evaporation in such a basin.were not more rapid than in the neigh-
bouring porticus of the ocean, the level of the basin must nevertheless
sink relatively to the ocean's, because the contractiori of the basin's
mouth in a certain degree obstructs the under-circulation, which·iu the
ocean carries water from localities of overabundant raiufall to those of
overabundant evaporation. As regards the nature of the stream, produ-
ced by evaporation, when passing a relatively narrow canal, such as
the Straits of Gibraltar, it must necessarily be very different from the
stream, which evaporation causes in the open ocean; for the proportion
between the evaporating surface and the area of the section of the
stream is in this case' altogether different. should the 88011011 of the
canal in proportion to the quantity of water, that must pass through it
in a unit of time in order 10 compensate the evaporation, be less than
a certain limit, there 0311 118 only 0118 stream, which will flow in the
evaporating region, where the saltness in such cases must contiuually
increase ²). When the depth of the 88011011 18 greater, there may on the

nor of the circumstance, that by evaporation the 8311 18 left in the water, whereby the
current might in time be considerably modified‚ even if exclusively arising from
evaporation. I shall have occasion further 011 to return to this question.

2) We do 1101 31 present know of any such 0388; 11111 11131 under past geolo-
gical periods basins have been gradually so cut off from communication with 1118
open sea, that an effective double circulation became impossible, 18 evidenced by the
numerous deposited layers of ordinary salt, more .or less visibly accompanied by other
ingrediente of oceanic salt, 38 3180 by the pure sulphur in certain sedimentary forma-
tions, probably originating in sea-waters sulphates after their reduction through orga-
nic media. The process of these evaporating-operat-ions has probably been, that when
the outward under-current, in consequence of the increasing shallowness of the mouth,
ceased, the 0011181118 of the basin have by the continued stream of 8311 water from
the sea been converted into a salt lake, which eventually christalized. It has 111811
depended on other circumstances, 8. g. the afflux of river water, whether the residual
lye has been carried off, or as in the formation of the Stassfurter-strata, 11 1138 dried
up. The new proposal to convert the Zahara-desert into a inland-sea would doubtless

,lead to a similar result.
