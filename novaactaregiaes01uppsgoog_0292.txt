borg. It should be remarked, that for a considerable time previously
uniform and calm summer weather had prevailed, that the little wind,
there was at the time, blew out from the mouth of the river and that
, the waters level was sinking. In a distance of 37300 Sweedish feet (1
Foot = 0297 metres = 11.689 English inches), half of which lay within
and half without the river's mouth, I on that day took samples of water
at 10 different places= on the middle line of the water’s breadth, where
the depth is greatest. That depth in the river was 2³7⁶ Sweedish fathoms
(the fathom being == 1.78 metres) but in ascending the river was gra·
dually reduced to 2 fathoms. In the fjord outside the mouth of the
river (Elfsborgsfjorden) the depth gradually increased from 3 to 7 fa-
thoms. At each of the 10 points one sample was taken at least for
each fathom of depth, beginning at the surface and continuing to the
bottom.·. The saltness ¹) per mille of each sample will be found in the
following table, which at the same time gives the distance in Sweedish
feet of each point from the river's mouth, and the depth in fathoms, at
which the sample was taken. I have added in parentheses the specific
weigth of each sample, which was first determined directly with twoo ex-

cellent areometers, and then reduced to the specific weight at the tem-

perature of ἰ-ἓζ, centigr. ²).—
