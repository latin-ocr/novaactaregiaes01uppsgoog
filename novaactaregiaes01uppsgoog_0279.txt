of the surface-stream, caused by the change of level, whereby the con-
traction in the vertical direction is dinziinished, and accordingly the diffe-
rences of pressure, that cause the under-current, exaggerated.

The effect then, that the earth's warming in the neighbourhood
of the equator and cooling in that of the poles would have upon the
position and motion of the strata in the ocean, ι] there were no otker
modifyinq circumstances, would be the following: The level of the sea
would be changed by rising at the equator and sinking at the poles.
The deviatione from the normal level, which would thus arise, would
in some measure approximate to those, which according to the laws of
equilibrium in communicating tubes, would be calculated to take place,
supposing the waters specific weight at different depths to be accurately
. known. Two superficial currents of warm water would flow from the
equ-ator towards the poles, and two less rapid under-currente of cold
water in the opposite direction. All these streame would diffuse them·
selves uniformely over the whole breadth of the ocean, with only such
modifications as would arise from the form of the continents and the ro-
tation of the earth. There would in short be a circulation «sustained by
difference of temperature alone», in its nature something similar to what
D:r CARPENTER has described, though in its causes different..

The great effect, that the cooling of the ocean's surfacehas upon
⁸ the temperature of the deeper waters, has been fully developed by D:r
GARPENTER and Ι have therefore barely touched upon it. I do not how·
ever consider, that the account he has given of the oceanic circulation‚
arising from variation of temperatura ¹), agrees with what Ι have above
described. If Ι rightly understand him, he supposes the ocean-surface
at ⁴the poles to be on a level with that at the equator. In this case a
pillar of water at the poles, extending to a certain depth below the
surface‚ would exert a considerably greater pressure than a correspon-
ding one at the equator on account of the formers greater specific gra-
vity. and this difference of pressure ought, according to D:r CARPENTER,
to be the driving force, that elevates the water at the equator. The
driving force producing the circulation lies, according to his vieW, not
