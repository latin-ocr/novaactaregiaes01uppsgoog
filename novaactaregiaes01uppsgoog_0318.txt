as one can see, acquire any increase from any separate circumstances,
Tho stream, already from its commencement diffused over a tolerably
wide surface, presses itself in consequence of westward deviation towards
the American coast line, by friction against which it must lose a portion
of its power. As regards the ascending stream, the differences of level,
which drive it, are also originally but small, consisting of a change os the
water’s volume through heat. Of itself that change of volume would
probably only have produced a very shallow and feeble stream. But we
have seen how that stream by the agency of the winds has had its
starting point removed to the Eastern coast of America, there acquired
an increased driving force in the difference of level, caused by the trade·
winds, and then, after having been further reinsorced by the effects of
other circumstances, let out with collected forces to find its way through
the free ocean. Ι suppose that, when all these circumstances are taken
into consideration, the grounds here assigned as the origin os the streams
will not be found contrary to our experience of the course of these sur·
face-currents, even though we cannot give a numerical proof of their
correctness.

To resume now the thread of our explanation, which has been
for a moment broken off, I must remind the reader of what I stated
some time back, that every ocean-current must have its course in a cer-
tain measure dependent on the possibilities, that are presented of its
combining with other ocean-currente. Both the ascending warm surface·
stream and the descending cold must by mechanical reaction give rise
to an afflux of water to the region, where they pass. The descending
stream has its origin partially from the Icy ocean on the North of Asia;

· this stream unites with one descending between Spitzbergen and Green-

land, and lastly we may add the stream coming from Baffin's Bay and
the neighbouring tracts. Throughout the whole of this long line the
cold surface-current must evoke reaction-streams, with which the warm
ascending stream can combine, and in this I see a separate cause, why
the Gulf-stream after having long previously lost its proper intensity
and its marked character as a stream, nevertheless continues as a drift
stream to extend itself past the coasts of Scandinavia up even to Spitz-
bergen and into the Asiatic Icy Ocean. ,The Gulf-stream must in turn
bring about a reaction-stream in the opposite direction, with which the
cold descending surface-stream can partially unite. Whe have thus, in
addition to the above adduced principal cause for a descending cold
