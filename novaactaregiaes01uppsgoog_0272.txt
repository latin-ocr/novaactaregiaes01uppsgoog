of the ocean, and every motion in one part must give rise to motion in
other parts, every ocean-current strictly speaking depende on many such
causes. The, business of the hydrographer should therefore be rather to
discover what part each of them has in the formation of the separate
streams, than to carry ’ out any particular theory grounded upon any
special cause. A quantitative determination of this kind can however at
present only be placed among things to be wished for, as the amount of
observations, necessa‘ry for its carrying out, does not as yet exist, and
the calculat-ion of the effects moreover presupposes both the number’and
nature of the cooperating causes accurately known. The opposite views

that even up to the present time are entertained on this subject, seem ο

to indicate that the preparation of the question is not yet sufficiently
advanced, and it is the object of the present work to contribute in some
means to the supplying of this deficiency.

For our purpose I divide the above mentioned causes into two
groups, namely A) such as produce α chanye in the water’s level and thu-<-
indirectly ι(Ιὶυε riae to streams; and B) such ως immediately produce a stream.
in consequence of the mechanica! action, which a medium already in motion
mermes ‹m' the wate-r. To this last category, (which must itself also pro-
duce a change of level) belong winds and the efflux of rivers; further-
more every ocean-current, however it may have originated‚ immediately
becomes itself such a cause. To the former category belong especially
variation of temperature in the seawater, evaporation and the meteoric
rain-fall.

A( CAUSES, WHICH INDIREGTLY PRODUOE OGEANIG STREAMS

The form of a sphero'ide of revolution, 'which the surface of the
ocean would otherwise assume, is subject to small perturbations. In addi-
tion to the periodical disturbance produced by the MooN's attraction, we
have in the first place that, which results from the unequal distribution
of the atmospheric pressure. According to the mean barometric 'pres-
sure in the neighbourhood of the Atlantic in the northern hemisphere‚
as determined by Sonouw and Poocnnnom-F, and the barometerobserva-
tions in the southern hemisphere, collected by MAURY, the surface of the
ocean at the equator appears to stand about 11 centimetres higher than
at the tropics; in consequence of the diminishing of the barometric
