Although in the ocean reaction-streams may, as we have seen,
arise from many 9911898, Ι will here in the first place confine myself to
those produced by the outflow of rivere, because from the special exam-
ples of such streame, which I have the opportunity of adducing, the
reader will be better able to form an idea of the nature of reaction-
streame. Before however passing to these examples, it will be neces-
sary to take a somewhat general view of the question of river· -water's
effect upon the sea.

It has long been observed that-in straits, which unite the ocean
with separated oceanic basius, in which the annual influx of river-water
exceeds the evaporation from the surface, there is beneath the superfi-
cial current, which carries off the superfluous river-water to the sea, an
under-current of salt water in the opposite direction. This phoenomenon
is in fact of a still more general nature. Every river or brock, which
falls into the sea, gives rise to an under-current directed towards its
embouchure. These under-currents are so distinct and the causes, that
produce them, so active, that in calm weather their presence may be
easily observed at the mouth of the most insignificant rivulet, that falls
out over the surface of the sea.

It has been usual to explain the under· current in such straits, as
e. g. Oresund, by supposing that the 899- -water outside in consequence
of its greater specific gravity displaced the fresher and lighter water in
the separated ocean-basin and thus flowed into it in the form of an
under-current. The same reasoning ought therefore to be applied to the
under-currente at the mouths of rivers. This explanation, however simple
it may appear, seems nevertheless on closer examination not to be satis-
factory. If we supposed the outflow from a river suddenly to stop,
as soon as the river had deposited a certain quantity of fresh water on
the surface of the sea, not only would assuredly a superficial current of
outflowing fresh water arise, but also an under-current of salt-water in
the opposite direction in consequence of the water-stratas differences of
pressure, and these would continue till the fresh water was carried off,
according to what has above been explained more fully in the case of
streame caused by heat and rainfall. But if the river continued to flow
with the same velocity, which caused the formation of the fresh-water-
stratum before the mouth, it seems clear, that water could not run away
in consequence of the excess of hydrostatic pressure more rapidly, than
