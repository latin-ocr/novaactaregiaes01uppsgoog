that the river-water, streaming onward from behind, could constautly
supply the loss, caused by the outHOW, and preserve the level unchan-
ged. Thus the cause of the under-current, which in the former case
was occasioned by the reduced hydrostatic pressure of the superficial
water in consequence of the sinking of the level, does not in this case
exist. Hence the difference of specific weight between river-and sea-
water ought here only to produce differences of level, which also should
be constant as long as the supply of river-water is continued and con·
stant. I look upon the under-current, which, in these cases, very di'-
stinctly appears, as a reaction·stream, to be accounted for on the gene-
ral principles, above laid down for the explanation of such streams. But
the same causes, which produce an under-current at the mouths of rivers,
must also give rise to an under-current in the channels, whereby separate
ocean-basius discharge their superfluous fresher water into the ocean.

This seems to be the place to say a few words on the reaction-
streams in lakes as compared with those in the ocean. Our knowledge
of the former is indeed very scanty, nevertheless the general experience
we have of streame in lakes would seem to justify our assuming, that
the under-currents, produced by the reaction of rivers in lakes, are far ⁵
inferior in intensity to· those producedin the sea. What then, it will
be asked, is the cause of this difference, if the under-current in the sea
is not caused by difference of pressure, depending on the different spe-
cific weight of the water?

In the first place the changes of level, occasioned by the pouring
of fresh water into fresh, can only produce such disturbances of equili-
brium as extend all the way to the bottom; but the movements, that re·
sult from this disturbances, ought not, as I have just said, to be follo-
wed in any-great degree by any reaction-stream. Secondly, when a
river falls into a lake, the mo'lecules of river-water have no reasomto
change the direction of their motion, unless obliged by the contour of
the shore. The river-water therefore proceeds as a distinct stream in
the upper water-strata, the particles of which it sets in motion by fric-
tion. But the reaction-stream, thus caused, must show itself in an afflux
of water from the sides as well as from below, and in many instances,

. in consequence of the lake's form and depth, the requisite quantity of

water can most easily be brought to the stream in the first mentioned
manner. Accordingly the reaction- -streams, resulting from rivers, will
in fresh· water lakes chiefly take the form of eddy- -streams on each side
of the almost strait stream of river-water.
