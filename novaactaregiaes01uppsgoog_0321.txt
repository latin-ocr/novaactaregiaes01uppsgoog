opinion most mighty os the ocean-currente, viz: the deep streams towards
the equator produced by evaporation and rainfall.

Although I am fully persuaded, that many particular phoenomena
concerning the ocean-currente, with ’11111011 I have been here engaged,
might receive their proper illustration by the application of the princi-
ples above laid down, as also that the phoenomena of the ocean-currente
in other parts of the ocean than the North-Atlantic may be explained
by them, I confine myself here to 1116 general application of these prin-
ciples, which Ι have already made, partly because this has been sufficient

sor my main purpose, and partly because my time, occupied as it is by ·

quite different objects, does not sor the present admit of my extending
this investigation further. This last circumstance is also the reason, why

⁴ I have not more perfectly touched upon the works 011 1116 631116 subject

put forth by other investigators os nature. The observatione of the

water's saltness round the Swedish coasts, that Ι have from time to time .

for several years collected, have 111 fact only lately led me to endeavour
to deduce from them results of more general importance, and if in set-
ting forth these Ι had been able to pay to the literature of the subject
as much attention as might have been desirable, I should have been
obliged to defer their publication to an undetermined time. If therefore,
as may very possibly be the case, Ι may have happened to overlook any
important matter, which has been illustrated by others, I must beg that
the circumstances here mentioned may 116 taken as an explanation of
the, omission. ,

and os thankfulness for what I have learned from him, is MAURY. With
1116 noblest devotion to his subject and led by the true instinct of the
student of nature to examine everything, he endeavoured 10 take into
account all circumstances, which might contribute, however little, to the
explanation of the currents and circulation of the Ocean. The original
dependence of these on the unequal distribution of the solar 11631 116
most prosoundly comprehended, and being thoroughly acquainted with
the phoenomena os the ocean, the differences between the streams, that
‘arise in salt and in fresh water, were well known to him. But just this
last circumstance seems to have led him, amongst the many various
effects, into which the influence of the solar heat- on the ocean divides
