rents are the consequence, The heavier water goes towards the lighter,
and the lighter whence the heavier comes; for two fluids differing in sp.
‚gravity, and standing at the same level, can no more balance each other
than unequal weights in the opposite scales of a true balance.» We see
that according to this’ view the first impulse to the stream arises from
the heavier water, which, as standing at the same level as the lighter,
in consequence of its greater weight displaces the latter in the deeper
strata. In this manner Mum endeavours to explain the under-current
in straits, which unite oceanic basius of different degrees of saltness,
and this explanation is accepted by CAnPssn'rssa and others.

It seems to me, that this explanation of the under-current, which
has moreover been extensively applied to streams in the open ocean,
too implicitly reposes on the common notion of the fixed level of the
ocean's surface, and that the following theorems, however simple, deserve
especial attention, in as much as that they must be the. foundation of a
correct comprehension of the phoenomenon. .

lto) When the equilibrium between two masses of water has been
disturbed, two cases are possible, §namely a), when the equilibrium is
disturbed throughout all the strata down to the bottom and b), when the
equilibrium is disturbed only to a certain depth below the surface. The
first case happens, when the specific gravity in both masses is the same,
but the level different, or the level the same, but the sp. gravity, at least
in the upper strata, different. The latter case presupposes, that the spe-
cific weight in both masses is in the lower strata the same, but different

in the strata situated above a certain level, and moreover that the ·

thickness of these latter strata is inversely as their specific gravities.

220) Between two strata of water of the same level and depth, but
of different specific gravity, there will be a difference of pressure, which at
the surface = O, but- increases with the depth below the surface. Should
however the lighter water be so much raised, that the difference of
pressure at its greatest depth vanishes, then at any point above that
depth the lighter water will produce a greater pressure than the heavier,
and the difference increase as we approach the surface; but the sum of
the differences of pressure of the two strata will be less iu the latter
position than in the former.

320) When the equilibrium between two masses of water is distur-
bed, the motion of the particles will be such as ιο restore the equili-
brium at the least possible expense of time and action. For a given
difference of pressure the required motion will occupy more time, when
