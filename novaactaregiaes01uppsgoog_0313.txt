its dilatation through heat will already be tolerably rapid at a tempera-
ture as low as -ι- 4⁰ Ceut, and that the dilatation‚ though it really in-
creases at higher temperatures, does not increase so rapidly as at lower.

We see here that the dilatation of sea-water at the temperatures,
which take place in the superficial strata of the warmer seas, is not so
much greater than that of pure water, although at low temperatures‚ which
even there may be met with deep under the surface, it can be 10
times more rapid. Evaporation on the other hand at low temperatures
is small, but increases very rapidly with increased temperature. The in·
fluence of the sea-salt in hindering evaporation is more sensible at low
than at high temperatures, although that influence of 3¹s, p. c. salt is
in general very trifling.

Let us suppose the whole ocean to have had a temperature of
for example ÷ 4⁰ Oent.‚ and that the unequal distribution of the solar
heat were just beginning to influence the surface. As the evaporation
of the water would at such a, temperature be slow‚ whereas its dilata-
tion would already be tolerably rapid, the first effect of the heat ought
chiefly to be a surface-current from the equator towards the polee, follo-
wed by an under-circulation in the opposite directim, as I have shown
in explaining the streame produced by heat. This under-circulation will
