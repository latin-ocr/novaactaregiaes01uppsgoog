pressure from that latitude to the pole it ought at 75⁰ N. Lat. to stand
about 11 centimetres and at 74⁰ South Lat. about 40 centimetres higher
than at the tropice. If the difference in the atmospheric pressure were
absolutely constant, this difference of level could not give rise to any
stream, but the water-particles of the inclined surfaces would move with
equal facility in any direction.· Only when, from some other cause, the
water streams from one latitude to another, can the difference of the
mean barometric pressure have 'a modifying influence on the motion of
the stream. The streame, that fiow from the tropice towards the poles, Ι
will have their movement very slightly facilitated, those flowing in the
opposite direction will be retarded, but accelerated again, as soon as
they· have passed the tropics.

Every variation of the atmospheric pressure must cause water to
flow from one place to another; but these changes, being only occasional
and of short continuance, can have only atrifling effect upon the real
oceanic currente, although they may have a more considerable temporary
influence on the streams in straits, which unite separate oceanic basius
with *eachothen ·

The changes of level, caused by heat and cold, evaporation and
rainfall, on the other hand may give rise to constant movements in the
sea-water3 for these operate with an average constant difference of force
on different portions of the ocean. I have already said, that they cause
streams in consequence of changes in the level of the sea. They how-
ever also ·alter the volume and specific gravity of the sea-water, the
latter partly by changing its saltness and partly its temperature.

Each of these changeshas its effect upon the ocean's circulation,
and I cannot consider it as a matter of iudifference, whether we assume
one or the other of them as the immediate cause of the resulting
stream. MAURY, and many others after him, 'have pointed out as the
cause the variation of the specific gravity of the sea-water. When for
example he in the chapter: «The origin of Currents» epitomizes his view
of the subject, he uses the following words: ¹) «If we except the tides
and the partial currents of the sea, such as those which may be created
by the wind, we may lay down as a rule, that all the currents of the
ocean owe their origin to difference of specific gravity between sea-
water at one place and sea-water at another; for wherever there is such
a difference, . . . . . it is a difference that disturbs equilibrium and cur-
