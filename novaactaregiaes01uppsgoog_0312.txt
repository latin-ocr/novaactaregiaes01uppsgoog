difference will, as we find, be largely increased. What then ought to
be the final result of these changes of level? Will it be a single current
towards the equator, driven by the difference of level arising from eva-
poration and rainfall, diminished by that arising from heat? Or will it
be two opposite streams, the one driven by the former difference undi-
minished, and the other by the latter difference? The answer to this
question is evident from what has preceeded. The difference of level,
produced by the combined effects of evaporation and rainfall, disturbed
the equilibrium of the ocean down to the bottom, that arising from heat
disturbed it only to a certain limited depth. The result will accordingly
be two streams, one of large section, towards the equator, the other a
shallow surface-current of warm water, from the equator; and the former
stream, as being caused by a more rapid change of level, will carry to-
wards the equator far more water in a unit of time, than the latter will
carry from it. In addition to these two motions there will be a third,
viz a surface-stream, descending towards lower latitudes, caused by the
disturbance of the superficial strata's equilibrium, which was the second
consequence of rainfall.

The origin of these vast streams then is to be looked for in di-
sturbances of the ocean’s level so small, that their daily amount can
only be expressed in millimetres and fractione of millimetres. But, when
these little changes of level begin to work upon the quiescent mass, the
difference of level increases in a more rapid ratio than the stream it
produces, and, when both at last have reached a constant state, the dif-
ference of level may easily be considerable.

From the fact, that the change of level produced by evaporation
and rainfall is greater than that resulting from heat, we are not forced
to conclude, that the sea-level around the polarcircle is higher than
at the equator: for the descending current, which the former in combi-
nation produce, has a far greater depth than the ascending warm stream,
and the difference of level, which occasions the former stream, may
therefore much sooner arrive at its maximum than that, which has to
drive the latter. As regards this question I may· refer the reader to
what Ι have above more fully said, regarding the motion of surface-
currents in comparison with under· streams.

In order to get a clearer view of the nature of the streams be-
fore us, let us first endeavour to understand how they might originate,
if the ocean were previously at rest. Here we must recollect, that,
since the maximum density of sea-water takes place at — 4⁰ Gentig.
