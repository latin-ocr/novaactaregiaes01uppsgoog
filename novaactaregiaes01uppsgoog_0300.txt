current, which prefers to run deep, is rendered very difficult by the
narrow passages between the Danish Isles, and because various circum-
stances sometimes facilitate and sometimes render difficult the passage of
the under-current through these aperturos, the supply of that current's
water is necessarily very irregular.

The southern part of the Baltic is comparatively shallow, seldom
below 56ο N. Lat. exceeding 50 fathoms (89 metres); between the
southern extremity of Sweden and the German coast the greatest depth
is only. about half that amount. F arther north to the East and North of
Gotland we find depths of above 100 or even 200 fathoms (178 and 356
meh). From some experiments‚ which I made in the years 1870 and
·1871 on the saltness of different depths in the Baltic ¹), it appeared among
other things, that the saltness in samples taken at the bottom at depths
of 20 and 26 fathoms (36 and 46 metres) in'the shallow line between
Skane and Rfigen, that is to say at the entrance of the Baltic itself‚ was
only 0.73 to 0.91 (70, whereas 32 Engl. sea-miles to the East of Born-
holm there was water of 47 fathoms (84 met.) depth with l.44 οἷο, and
at 120 fathoms (214 met.) depth to the East of Gotland with l.l2 ⁰!'0
salt, and at 160 fathoms depth (285 met.) 48 Engl. sea-miles N. of Got-
land with LOO ⁰l0 salt. These facts place it beyond doubt, that the un·
der-current in the Baltic is not continuous, but passes with greater or
less strength and with longer or shorter interruptione over its bottom‚
filling its hollows. ·

Although the Baltic, the Botten-sea and the Gulf of Bothnia are
but slightly separated from eachother‚ yet their waters at the surface
differ largely in saltness, a clear proof that the superficial current, caused
by the river-water, sensibly affects even these large surfaceS‚ although
it may be scarcely visible to ordinary observation. Samples, collected
from the surface of, the Gulf of Bothnia, display a saltness of trom O.15 to
0.35 ⁰l0, those from Bottenhaf from O.48 to 0.5ι ⁰l0. The surface-water
in the Baltic, according to the specimens I examined‚ contained from
O.72 to 0:79 ⁰s0 salt, the higher number belonging to the southern part;
down toa depth of 20 fathoms (36 met.) the water showed scarcely
any change of saltness. In the vicinity of the Danish islands the saltness
of the surface-current ie, as many have observed‚ rapidly increased‚ be-
cause it here comes more nearly in contact with the under-current,

¹) The samples were collected by two younger scientific gentlemen Docent
chxnorr and Docent Ounno, who accompanied a Swedish deep-sounding expedition.
