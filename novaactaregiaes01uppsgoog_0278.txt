area to move through, the differences of pressure, which drove the sur-
face-stream, would require to be about equal to those, which drove the
under-current, or the position of the warm stratum would be about in the
middle between the extremes above mentioned. But, as the case really is in
the ocean, the section of the sursace-stream is far less than that of the
under-stream, and accordingly the differences of pressure, which drive
the superficial current, must be very considerably greater than those,
which set in motion the under-current. Or in other words: The position
os tlte marm stratum must be much nearen- to that, which its spec-{fic yravity
would assiyn to it, than to the other eoetreme. Here no allowance has been
made for the change in the position of the strata, which may arise from
the vis viva of the streams produced.

If the water at the surface of the ocean is cooled t'o a lower
temperature than the subjacent strata, the water at the surface becomes
heavier, and supposing the saltness of the lower strata not to be greater,
it must, like every other heavier body, sink towards the bottom. If the
cooling over the whole locality be uniform and constant, there will re-
sult a vertical circulation, which will continue till all the water has rea-
ched the same temperature. If on the other hand only a portion of the
surface is exposed to cooling ι influence from above, the level of that
portion will sink below that of the rest and there will result an externa]
stream towards the chilled place, arising from the greater hydrostatic
pressure of the surrounding warmer water. But in this case there arises
at the same time a new current, independent of the change of level; sor
the chilled water, in consequence of its increased specific gravity, siuks,
displaces the water which previously formed the bottom-'strata and diffu-
ses itself under them. These motions, if the water in the unchilled
locality were unable to receive heat, would continue, though with less
and less velocity, untill the whole mass of water had reached the tem-
perature of the chilled place. ·

The changes of volume, which the superficial water undergoes
from raised or lowered temperature are however accompanied by the
following phoenomena. When the superficial water is anywhere warmed,
its dilatation in horizontal dimensions experiences a resistance from the
adjoining strata, the effect of which must be to cause the chief dilata-
tion to be in the vertical direction3 this increases the differences of
pressure, which give rise to superficial current, while the resistance to
the advancing under-current is diminished. And vice versa, when the
surface is cooled, its horizontal contraction is accelerated by the pressure
