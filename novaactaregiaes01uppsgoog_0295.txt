itself this increase augments in rapid progression, so that e. g. 100 vo·
lumes of river-water, at 6000 foots distance outside the ,mouth of the
river, will according to the same calculation have grown to 552 volumes.
That the velocity of the stream cannot decrease in' the same progres-
sion, in which the volumes increase, I have before endeavoured to show;
the figures here· adduced can therefore give an· idea, although imperfect,
how much larger the stream is, which a river produces in the sea, than
the original river itself. The examination of the velocity of the stream
at different depths, etc., necessary for the complete discussion of the
question, circumstances however did not allow me to⁶undertake.

If the under-current here described were caused by differences of
pressure, dependent on the difference of specific gravity between sea· and
river-water, those differences of pressure would necessarily be very con·
siderable, for they would have to drive the sea-water at least 12000
Metres from the Kattegat to the mouth of the river, and when there to
raise it from the lower to the higher level, press it in through the
mouth of the river, and then drive it 5 or 6 Kilometres up the bed of
the river, in doing which it would have to overcome both the friction
against the bottom and that of the powerful outflowing stream of the
river. If we now cast our eyes on the table of the specific weights ob-
served, we find, that, as regards the strata of water between the bottom
and 2 fathoms depth under the surface, the specific weight of such a
column of water, taken anywhere whatever, will be equal to or greater
than the specific weight of an equally high column, taken at the station
farthest out from land ¹). In order to account for the under-current we
have also nothing left, but the difference of specific weight, which the
pillars of fluid above the depth of 2 fathoms under the surface exhibit.
If then we assume for the pillar farthest out to sea a specific weight of
Luam, such as I observed in the Kattegat at Winga, and for the oppo-
site side a specific weight of 1.000, the difference of pressure for a height
of 2 fathoms will correspond to the pressure of 6 centimetres of pure
water, which pressure would be attained only when the two extremities
of the space were on the same level. But this last condition is impos·
sible, for the tolerably strong stream of the river presupposes a certain
inclination of its surface. In order that the level of the river at the

¹) 1 may add that at that season of the year one does not in the Kattegat‚
outside the opening of the {joi-d, meet with sensibly beavier water, than at correspon-

ding depth near tharissa-mouth.
