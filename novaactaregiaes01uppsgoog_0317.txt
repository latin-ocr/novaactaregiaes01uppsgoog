strength of the Gulf-stream. Even if the access of river-water and the·
greater amount of rain in the Gulf of Mexico are not sufficient to pro-
duce an absolute rise of the water’s level, they must at any rate operate
essentially to prevent a sinking of the surface through evaporation, and
thus effect a rise relatively to the ocean outside the Gulf. To this must
be added also the influence of the reaction-streams of rivers, if indeed
these, as is probable, are fed from the ocean itself. We should remem-
ber that river-water, which is poured into an ocean-gulf, even if it had
just time to evaporate before leaving the gulf, must nevertheless pro-
duce an out-flowing stream, because the reaction-currents, which the
river-water has drawn into the gulf, must somewhere or other find their
way out again. .

But one of the chief causes of the strength of the Atlantic Gulf-
stream and of the great extent towards the North-east of the surface-
drift, which forms a continuation of its motion, I conceive to be the
free communication between the Atlantic and the Arctic-Oceans ¹), and
the relation that thence arises between the two surface-streams, namely
the ascending warm and salt, and the descending cold and diluted. We
remember that this latter stream was a secondary effect of rainfall, rain-
forced by the surface·stream, which cold produced by forming ice, which
is afterwards dissolved by the water. It may perhaps seem as if this
descending stream ought, if the above given grounds, for the explanation
of the ocean-streams be accepted, to oppose an insuperable obstacle to
the progress of the ascending stream, in as much namely as the chan-
ges of level, that give rise to the streams, appear to operate at every
instant to establish a higher sea-level in higher than in lower latitudes.
But we must recollect, that the causes most effective towards this end,
viz: the absolute amount ’of rainfall and evaporation, produced a very
deep stream and thus in proportion to the greatness of the change of
level, a relatively small difference of level. This difference might fur-
ther, as I have above shown, be compensated by the effect of heat,
without the surface-current, which was produced by heat, being debilitated.

The difference of level again, which causes the descending surface-
current, depends exclusively on tlte relation between the surface-stratas
specffic weiqhtS, and must therefore be very small, and does not, as far

¹) Dr. CAnPnnvnR has experienced tbe same opinion though upon different
grounds, namely on the ground of a supposed suction, occasioned by the water sin-
king in the cold polar regions of the ocean.
