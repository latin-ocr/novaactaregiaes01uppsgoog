has there to pass over bars, which have, at the most, 10 to 13 fathoms
(18 . . . 23 metres) of water over them. Between the Danish Islands and
the Skagerack the depth increases on the whole pretty uniformly to
about 30 fathoms (54 metres), though at places depths of 50 fathoms (89
met.) have been fonnd'. But in the Skagerack the depth increases very
rapidly, so that between Jutland and Norway the depth sometimes ex·
ceeds 300 fathoms (534 met.) and reaches 100 fathoms (178 metres) at
many places near the Swedish coast. This deep channel, as is known,
thence continues along the coast of Norway3 its south terminus penetra-
tes some distance into the Kattegat with a depth -of about 50 fathoms (89
metr.). The oceanic under-current has then in this part a very free approach
and the locality is accordingly characterized by umform saltness in deep
water and variable ‚at the surface. At 340 fathoms (606 metres) I obtai-
ned samples of 3.515 ⁰,s0 saltness3 at 100 fathoms near the Swedish coast
the saltness is 3.50 ‘'5'0, and at 10 fathoms (17.8 met.) Ihave never found
less than 3 Ὑο. But at depths less than that the differences of saltness
are far greater. The outflowing upper-current, in consequence of east-
ward deviation‚ keeps near the Swedish land, and by its bottom and
west side affects the surrounding sea-water, thus producing a reaction-
stream. The water, that flows in through the Skagerack, does not there-
fore go exclusively to compensate, in the form of an under-current, that
water, which is carried off from the Kattegat and the inner basins by
the surface-current, bnt a great part of it proceeds in the form of a
stream, that reaches up to the snrsace, along the Danish coast towards
the Swedish coast, to unite itself in the Skagerack with the outfiowing
stream, which falls into the North-Sea at the southern coast of Norway.
Thus, while the saltness on the Jntland-coast approaches that of the
North-Sea-water, that on the Swedish coast is only about 22¹2 ⁰:'0 in sum-
mertime3 it moreover exhibits great changes at different seasons and
under different circumstances, because the causes, which determine the
strength of the surface-current and the efflux of the superficial water
from the Skagerack, are subject to variation.

In the Kattegat the ‚saltness of the surface-current is far less than
in the Skagerack, because it has not yet received the above mentioned
reaction-stream„ In the northern part of the Kattegat the saltness is
about 2 ⁰7¹0, but in the southern parts the percentage sinks considerably
below that. The saltness of the under-current is here also less, because
it is here obliged to approach nearer to the upper fresher water-strata.
Nevertheless the under-current in the south part of the Kattegat and in
