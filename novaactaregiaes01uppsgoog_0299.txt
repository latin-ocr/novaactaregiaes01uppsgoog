the straits between the Danish islands can occasionally display almost
the same saltness as in the Skagerack, as far as we can judge from the
observations, taken at the statione established by D:r A. Mareu. Several
causes may contribute to this, and more especially the velocity with
which the under-current passes through the Kattegat3 moreover under
certain circumstances the character of the streame in the Skagerack and
Kattegat may be completely changed, so that the superficial current also
runs into the Baltic,

As regards the peculiar conformation of the sea-bottom in the
parts we have just been consideriug, or the deep trough-formed channel,
which extends along the Swedish and Norwegian coasts, it appears to
me almost beyond a doubt, that it is the effect of the under-current,
which has prevented there the deposition of the sediments, which now
cover the bottom of the North sea. This however was most probably
principally done at an epoch, when both streams, the upper muddy
stream of riverwater, as will as the under-current, ran with far greater

ἱ force than at present. The causes of such a state of the streame may

be found in the latter part of the North-European glacial period. The
quantity of river-water, which, when contemporaneously with the land's
sinking the glaciers melted, was thrown into the ocean, must then have
been far greater, and more loaded with mud than nOW, and the reaction-
streams, occasioned by that river-water in the ocean, must have been all
the more powerful for that the sinking of the land was not yet comple-
ted, and therefore the area for the section of the reaction-streams was
smaller. That changes of this sort, such as channelling of the sea-bottom
where the under-stream is rapid, depositions where stillness of the water
prevails, etc., are still in progress is not to be doubted, and it would
be an interesting geological problem to investigate more accuratly the
effecte of this kind, produced by under-currente.

The inner basins of the system before us, the Baltic, the Bothnian
sea and the Gulf of Bothnia, unlike those above described, are charac-
terized by un{t’0rm saltness at the surface and vat-iable in the deeper
water ¹). The quantity of fresh water flowing hither is subject to less
sudden variatione, and differences of saltness, which may take place at dif-
ferent spots, are more easily equated by the effect of winds in the ex·
tensive very slowly flowing surface. But the approach of the salt under-

the Gulf of Bet-huia deep water observatione are 38 yet wanting.
